Marking mode update
-Marking on self marked questions is good.
-On automarked questions now i want to show question and score on that question for review.
-Use sample left right template as self marked questions just filled in.
-Styling and layout should be identical to self-marked but with no tick crosses input, these should be autofilled.
-Have next button flash after a 1 second delay for student to click.
-Go to next question (either self marked or automarked).
