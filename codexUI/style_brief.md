Breadcrumb:
Update the navigation page to match this layout rule:
Breadcrumb should be at the very top (above the main page title), left-aligned, in the same horizontal row as the “Back” link (if present), with the dark-mode toggle remaining top-right.
The navigation should now be Physics→Topic→Subtopic.  

Styling details:

Breadcrumb font-size ~ 18–20px on desktop (smaller than the main title)
Parent segment: color: var(--primary-blue) but slightly muted (e.g., opacity 0.85) and font-weight: 600
Current segment: near-black / var(--text) with font-weight: 600
Separator arrow: muted grey / opacity: 0.6
Row has comfortable padding-top (same as header area)
On mobile, breadcrumb can wrap to two lines, but keep spacing tidy
Ensure hover style on the parent segment indicates it’s clickable (underline on hover).
