On marking/review move the scoring so it now takes place immediately to the right of the submit button. the score no longer shows below the mark scheme.

it should be styled same height as the button, white lighter background. 

is should look like part of the same button, but with no hover and no submit.

the style of the new submit button and score is mocked up in the file submitbutton.png in this folder.
