# Implementation Rules

- Do not introduce new UI paradigms or gamification.
- Exam-style, calm, minimal UI takes priority over flair.
- Layouts must not rely on fixed positioning that causes overlap.
- Prefer small, local diffs over global refactors.
- When in doubt, preserve existing behaviour and styling.
