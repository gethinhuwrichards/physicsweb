Score
-After the marking is complete a new state should appear. 
-page should resemble marking mode in style, except no longer a left/right split. Example mockup given in design inspo folder (scorepagemockup.png)
-it should show the score out of the total available marks.
-there should be three buttons underneath the score. 
    -Try another question - takes back to question select in that subtopic.
    -Review question - takes back to the question which is now marked - basically this page is how marked questions presently appear. make only a cosmetic change, have score on question highlight yellow for partial credit, red for zero marks and green for full marks.
    -Reset question - sets question back to the inital blank state so student can go again, user is taken back to same question
- After questions are marked answers should be saved on client side so if question is returned to the previously entered answers are still there.
