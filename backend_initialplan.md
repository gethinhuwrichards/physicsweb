Backend needs to have:

- Accounts for each user.
- Login should be either through google account or verified email and password. i want data: name, email, password, year group. any more if you suggest.
- Should store student progress on the server side. I want to be able to see in detail how many questions user are completing, time on the site etc. 
- Should be able to restrict what accounts have access to what questions (with the possibility for monetised accounts in the future).
- I am happy to use supabase, though i don't know how to use it. claude in browser told me i should use it as i don't know backend at all.
- I want to give students access to about 3 questions, then i want to lock them out and force them to have an account.
