Context
The main site users are students age 14-16. they are answering exam questions and recieving feedback. their progress is then monitored.
The site works well but needs a UI/UX polish. 

Important to follow:
- No need to make major changes to the mechanics/logic, this redesign is about look and feel.

Some general guidance: 
- I want something more modern and sleek. The vibe should be mostly serious and scholarly, but not too dry. The school exam feel is important.
- Better typography - Use a more refined sans-serif, clear hierarchy
- More whitespace - Let content breathe
- Refined inputs - Cleaner text boxes, better dropdowns
- Design a light and dark mode with a toggle.   

Specific sections can be improved by:

Questions
    -Make the quiz title and total marks more prominent
    -Strengthen question part labels (a, b, c)
    -Improve text input visibility with better borders and contrast
    -Make the word bank buttons more distinct
    -Make dropdown menus more obviously interactive
    -Consider lightening the overall theme or adding contrast panels
    -Improve spacing throughout for better readability
    -There should be some encouragement/guidance to get students to fill in the text box questions.

Marking/review
    - Some parts need to be clearer, for example, when a student is required to self mark, there should be some clear visual hint. 
    - i like the left/right layout of the marking review but their are issues to fix: 
        -the headings are small and unclear. the marking points aren't highlighted. 
        -i don't like that the textbox/radio buttons/tick boxes appear in unedited form. Radio buttons/checkboxes still look clickable, its confusing because students think they can edit. Show the student's typed answer as plain formatted text (not in a text box) and selected radio button/checkbox answers as text (e.g., "You selected: Option B" (though you also need to show other options)). Make it clear this is REVIEW mode, not editing mode.
        -Make the student's answer more visible with better contrast
        -Improve readability of the marking scheme (especially the blue highlighted keywords)
        -Strengthen visual hierarchy - emphasize the score.
        -Make the checkmark/X buttons clearer with labels
        -Add a prominent 'Next Question' or 'Continue' button
        -Increase spacing between sections for better readability
        -Overall, make it feel less dark and easier to scan quickly

Navigation
    -Cards lack depth - They feel flat. Subtle shadows or borders would make them feel more clickable. White cards with subtle borders, soft shadows
    -Muted accent color: Deep navy blue or slate blue instead of bright blue. 
    -Professional spacing: More generous margins

Front page
    -Lighter background (off-white/cream like exam paper)
    -Single-color title (no split styling)
    -Muted professional blue for accents
    -More refined typography
    -Better visual hierarchy in the feature cards
