# Adding new tagging system to JSON questions. 

# Purpose
-Tags are for future proofing site. Will allow for filtering as question bank increases in size and questions are pulled from different sources. 

# Requirements
- Questions are tagged as 'pastpaper' or 'original'. This is either or, questions can only be of one type. Past papers are real questions which come from exam boards, original are ones generated and refined by myself.
- Questions are tagged by exam board/specification. Options are GCSE AQA, GCSE EDEXCEL, OCR, iGCSE Edexcel, iGCSE Cambrige. Questions only have one of these tags.  Make a seperate tag for subtype, this allows tagging of other exam boards/specifications as some questions may be appropriate for all. 
- There are two exam entries within each spec which we will call seperate science and combined science. all content on combined science is also in seperate. however, the opposite isn't true and some content in seperate is not in combined. we will assume this is true for each exam board individually. any filtering must show combined science questions when filtering for seperate science, but not visa versa.
- Questions will also be tagged with subject label. only physics applies for now, but leave room for others (maybe biology, chemistry etc.)
- Questions are tagged explicitly as GCSE (seperate from exam board/specification tag), we may include KS3, A-level and IB later. 

# Current questions
- All questions presently in jsons are GCSE, GCSE AQA, PHYSICS, Combined science. Tag them as such. if you think there is a needed tag missing please ask.
